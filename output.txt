|	flows twice in each lunar day or the space

|	is occasioned by the attraction of the sun
|	and moon (the influence of the latter being
|	three times that of the former) acting unequally
|	on the waters in different parts of the earth
|	thus disturbing their equilibrium. a high tide
|	upon one side of the earth is accompanied by
|	a high tide upon the opposite side. hence when
|	the sun and moon are in conjunction or opposition
|	as at new moon and full moon their action is
|	such as to produce a greater than the usual
|	tide called the spring tide as represented
|	in the cut. when the moon is in the first or
|	third quarter the sun's attraction in part
|	counteracts the effect of the moon's attraction
|	thus producing under the moon a smaller tide
|	than usual called the neap tide.

|foretelling | Definition:                                
|	shall v. i. & auxiliary. as an auxiliary shall
|	indicates a duty or necessity whose obligation
|	is derived from the person speaking; as you
|	shall go; he shall go; that is i order or promise
|	your going. it thus ordinarily expresses in
|	the second and third persons a command a threat
|	or a promise. if the auxillary be emphasized
|	the command is made more imperative the promise
|	or that more positive and sure. it is also
|	employed in the language of prophecy; as  >the
|	day shall come when . . .   > since a promise
|	or threat and an authoritative prophecy nearly
|	coincide in significance. in shall with the
|	first person the necessity of the action is
|	sometimes implied as residing elsewhere than
|	in the speaker; as i shall suffer; we shall
|	see; and there is always a less distinct and
|	positive assertion of his volition than is
|	indicated by will.  >i shall go > implies nearly
|	a simple futurity; more exactly a foretelling
|	or an expectation of my going in which naturally
|	enough a certain degree of plan or intention
|	may be included; emphasize the shall and the
|	event is described as certain to occur and
|	the expression approximates in meaning to our
|	emphatic  >i will go. > in a question the relation
|	of speaker and source of obligation is of course
|	transferred to the person addressed; as  >shall
|	you go? > (answer  >i shall go >);  >shall
|	he go? > i. e.  >do you require or promise
|	his going? > (answer  >he shall go >.) the
|	same relation is transferred to either second
|	or third person in such phrases as  >you say
|	or think you shall go; >  >he says or thinks
|	he shall go. > after a conditional conjunction
|	(as if whether) shall is used in all persons
|	to express futurity simply; as if i you or
|	he shall say they are right. should is everywhere
|	used in the same connection and the same senses
|	as shall as its imperfect. it also expresses
|	duty or moral obligation; as he should do it
|	whether he will or not. in the early english
|	and hence in our english bible shall is the
|	auxiliary mainly used in all the persons to
|	express simple futurity. (cf. will v. t.) shall
|	may be used elliptically; thus with an adverb
|	or other word expressive of motion go may be
|	omitted.

|prophecy | Definition:                                
|	shall v. i. & auxiliary. as an auxiliary shall
|	indicates a duty or necessity whose obligation
|	is derived from the person speaking; as you
|	shall go; he shall go; that is i order or promise
|	your going. it thus ordinarily expresses in
|	the second and third persons a command a threat
|	or a promise. if the auxillary be emphasized
|	the command is made more imperative the promise
|	or that more positive and sure. it is also
|	employed in the language of prophecy; as  >the
|	day shall come when . . .   > since a promise
|	or threat and an authoritative prophecy nearly
|	coincide in significance. in shall with the
|	first person the necessity of the action is
|	sometimes implied as residing elsewhere than
|	in the speaker; as i shall suffer; we shall
|	see; and there is always a less distinct and
|	positive assertion of his volition than is
|	indicated by will.  >i shall go > implies nearly
|	a simple futurity; more exactly a foretelling
|	or an expectation of my going in which naturally
|	enough a certain degree of plan or intention
|	may be included; emphasize the shall and the
|	event is described as certain to occur and
|	the expression approximates in meaning to our
|	emphatic  >i will go. > in a question the relation
|	of speaker and source of obligation is of course
|	transferred to the person addressed; as  >shall
|	you go? > (answer  >i shall go >);  >shall
|	he go? > i. e.  >do you require or promise
|	his going? > (answer  >he shall go >.) the
|	same relation is transferred to either second
|	or third person in such phrases as  >you say
|	or think you shall go; >  >he says or thinks
|	he shall go. > after a conditional conjunction
|	(as if whether) shall is used in all persons
|	to express futurity simply; as if i you or
|	he shall say they are right. should is everywhere
|	used in the same connection and the same senses
|	as shall as its imperfect. it also expresses
|	duty or moral obligation; as he should do it
|	whether he will or not. in the early english
|	and hence in our english bible shall is the
|	auxiliary mainly used in all the persons to
|	express simple futurity. (cf. will v. t.) shall
|	may be used elliptically; thus with an adverb
|	or other word expressive of motion go may be
|	omitted.

|require | Definition:                                
|	shall v. i. & auxiliary. as an auxiliary shall
|	indicates a duty or necessity whose obligation
|	is derived from the person speaking; as you
|	shall go; he shall go; that is i order or promise
|	your going. it thus ordinarily expresses in
|	the second and third persons a command a threat
|	or a promise. if the auxillary be emphasized
|	the command is made more imperative the promise
|	or that more positive and sure. it is also
|	employed in the language of prophecy; as  >the
|	day shall come when . . .   > since a promise
|	or threat and an authoritative prophecy nearly
|	coincide in significance. in shall with the
|	first person the necessity of the action is
|	sometimes implied as residing elsewhere than
|	in the speaker; as i shall suffer; we shall
|	see; and there is always a less distinct and
|	positive assertion of his volition than is
|	indicated by will.  >i shall go > implies nearly
|	a simple futurity; more exactly a foretelling
|	or an expectation of my going in which naturally
|	enough a certain degree of plan or intention
|	may be included; emphasize the shall and the
|	event is described as certain to occur and
|	the expression approximates in meaning to our
|	emphatic  >i will go. > in a question the relation
|	of speaker and source of obligation is of course
|	transferred to the person addressed; as  >shall
|	you go? > (answer  >i shall go >);  >shall
|	he go? > i. e.  >do you require or promise
|	his going? > (answer  >he shall go >.) the
|	same relation is transferred to either second
|	or third person in such phrases as  >you say
|	or think you shall go; >  >he says or thinks
|	he shall go. > after a conditional conjunction
|	(as if whether) shall is used in all persons
|	to express futurity simply; as if i you or
|	he shall say they are right. should is everywhere
|	used in the same connection and the same senses
|	as shall as its imperfect. it also expresses
|	duty or moral obligation; as he should do it
|	whether he will or not. in the early english
|	and hence in our english bible shall is the
|	auxiliary mainly used in all the persons to
|	express simple futurity. (cf. will v. t.) shall
|	may be used elliptically; thus with an adverb
|	or other word expressive of motion go may be
|	omitted.

|thinks | Definition:                                
|	shall v. i. & auxiliary. as an auxiliary shall
|	indicates a duty or necessity whose obligation
|	is derived from the person speaking; as you
|	shall go; he shall go; that is i order or promise
|	your going. it thus ordinarily expresses in
|	the second and third persons a command a threat
|	or a promise. if the auxillary be emphasized
|	the command is made more imperative the promise
|	or that more positive and sure. it is also
|	employed in the language of prophecy; as  >the
|	day shall come when . . .   > since a promise
|	or threat and an authoritative prophecy nearly
|	coincide in significance. in shall with the
|	first person the necessity of the action is
|	sometimes implied as residing elsewhere than
|	in the speaker; as i shall suffer; we shall
|	see; and there is always a less distinct and
|	positive assertion of his volition than is
|	indicated by will.  >i shall go > implies nearly
|	a simple futurity; more exactly a foretelling
|	or an expectation of my going in which naturally
|	enough a certain degree of plan or intention
|	may be included; emphasize the shall and the
|	event is described as certain to occur and
|	the expression approximates in meaning to our
|	emphatic  >i will go. > in a question the relation
|	of speaker and source of obligation is of course
|	transferred to the person addressed; as  >shall
|	you go? > (answer  >i shall go >);  >shall
|	he go? > i. e.  >do you require or promise
|	his going? > (answer  >he shall go >.) the
|	same relation is transferred to either second
|	or third person in such phrases as  >you say
|	or think you shall go; >  >he says or thinks
|	he shall go. > after a conditional conjunction
|	(as if whether) shall is used in all persons
|	to express futurity simply; as if i you or
|	he shall say they are right. should is everywhere
|	used in the same connection and the same senses
|	as shall as its imperfect. it also expresses
|	duty or moral obligation; as he should do it
|	whether he will or not. in the early english
|	and hence in our english bible shall is the
|	auxiliary mainly used in all the persons to
|	express simple futurity. (cf. will v. t.) shall
|	may be used elliptically; thus with an adverb
|	or other word expressive of motion go may be
|	omitted.
