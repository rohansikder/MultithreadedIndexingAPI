|	the waters of the ocean and of bays rivers
|	etc. connected therewith. the tide ebbs and
|	flows twice in each lunar day or the space
|	of a little more than twenty-four hours. it
|	is occasioned by the attraction of the sun
|	and moon (the influence of the latter being
|	three times that of the former) acting unequally
|	on the waters in different parts of the earth
|	thus disturbing their equilibrium. a high tide
|	upon one side of the earth is accompanied by
|	a high tide upon the opposite side. hence when
|	the sun and moon are in conjunction or opposition
|	as at new moon and full moon their action is
|	such as to produce a greater than the usual
|	tide called the spring tide as represented
|	in the cut. when the moon is in the first or
|	third quarter the sun's attraction in part
|	counteracts the effect of the moon's attraction
|	thus producing under the moon a smaller tide
|	than usual called the neap tide.
